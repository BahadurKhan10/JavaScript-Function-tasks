Sure! Here are some JavaScript loop tasks that you can practice:

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

Write a program that prints the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100.

Write a program that takes a string as input and prints its reverse. For example, if the input is "hello", the output should be "olleh".

Write a program that finds the factorial of a number. For example, if the input is 5, the output should be 120 (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5).

Write a program that takes an array of numbers as input and prints the largest and smallest numbers in the array.

Write a program that takes a number as input and checks whether it is a prime number or not.

Write a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. For example, if the input is 10, the output should be "0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8".

Write a program that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels in the string.

Write a program that takes a number as input and prints the sum of its digits. For example, if the input is 123, the output should be 6 (1 + 2 + 3).

Write a program that takes an array of numbers as input and prints the second largest number in the array.

These tasks should give you a good practice in writing loops and working with arrays and strings in JavaScript. Good luck!
